# bluetooth-chat

**Reason for improvement:**

A simple chat system that works with Bluetooth, this is the basis of a larger project that I will do in the future, I will not go into the details of the project, but it is something related to esp32 and smart home systems, the reason why I do it with bluetooth is that it works in environments where there is no internet.

**Server:**

![Client](https://github.com/f3riend/bluetooth-chat/blob/main/client.py)


**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install icecream
```

**NOTE:** You don't necessarily have to download it, you can replace the  *ic* function with print.
